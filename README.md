# WordPress Component Generator

This is a basic CLI that we use when creating ACF layouts or components.

Add the below to package.json

    "generate": "bun run ./generator/generate-component.js"

Check paths in generate-component.js to make sure files are placed in the correct place. 

Includes "g-component" markup for GIA
